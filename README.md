# SecureSphere: Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Project

## Overview

SecureSphere is a robust Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) designed to enhance the security and integrity of applications by providing a secure area within the processor. This environment ensures that code and data loaded inside are protected with respect to confidentiality and integrity, safeguarding against unauthorized access and tampering.

## Features

- **Confidential Computing**: Ensures that sensitive data is processed in an isolated environment, preventing exposure to unauthorized entities.
- **Integrity Protection**: Maintains the integrity of code and data, ensuring they remain unaltered during execution.
- **Secure Boot**: Verifies the authenticity of the system's firmware and software during startup, preventing malicious code execution.
- **Remote Attestation**: Allows verification of the TEE's integrity by external parties, ensuring trustworthiness.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Hardware**: A processor supporting TEE features (e.g., ARM TrustZone, Intel SGX).
- **Operating System**: A compatible OS that supports TEE functionalities.
- **Development Tools**: Appropriate SDKs and toolchains for TEE development.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/securesphere.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd securesphere
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   # For example, using a package manager
   sudo apt-get install [required-packages]
   ```

4. **Build the Project**:
